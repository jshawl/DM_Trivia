<p>What is Diabetes:  Diabetes is a disease that affects how sugar aka glucose is processed in the body.  When we eat, the body breaks down the food resulting in sugar being absorbed into the bloodstream.  The pancreas is an organ in the body that produces a hormone called insulin.  Insulin is needed so the the body can used the sugar.  Without insulin the sugar just stays in the bloodstream.  Sugar in the blood is checked by the doctor drawing lab work. The average result is 60-110. Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses glucose, the main type of sugar in the blood.  People who have Type 1  Diabetes,  their pancreas does not produce any insulin.  People with Type 2 Diabetes  their pancreas either does not make enough insulin or their body does not properly respond.</p>

<p>Symptoms to be aware of:</p>

<p>Hypoglycemia</p>
<p>This occurs when the blood sugar drops too low.  A blood test to check your blood sugar might have a result of < 60.  You might experience  shakiness, sweating, sleepiness, or fainting.</p>
<p>Hyperglycemia</p>
<p>This occurs when the blood sugar is too high.  A blood test to check your blood sugar might have a result of > 200.  You might not experience any symptoms.  But constantly having hight blood sugar is not good for the body and cause cause complications.<p>

<p>Complications: People with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes are also more likely to develop hypertension (high blood pressure) or abnormal levels of blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides). When these problems cluster together, doctors call this metabolic syndrome. People with metabolic syndrome have a greater risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.

Diabetes also can cause long-term complications, including heart disease, stroke, eye problems, kidney disease, nerve damage, and gum disease. While these problems don't usually show up in kids or teens who've had type 2 diabetes for only a few years, they can affect them in adulthood, particularly in those whose diabetes hasn't been well controlled.

Eat a healthy diet to help achieve a normal body weight while getting the nutrients needed to grow and develop. Doctors may recommend a low-salt or low-fat diet, especially if they have conditions such as high blood pressure or abnormal blood fat levels.

Participate in physical activity regularly. Exercise helps increase the body's response to insulin, and it helps the body burn more calories, which can promote the loss of excess body fat.

Monitor blood sugar levels as requested by the doctor. Take medication as prescribed.  If you are out of medications notify the doctor.  </p>
